## Unofficial Multi-architecture Resilio Sync Docker files

> **WARNING:** \
> This is still somewhat volatile while I settle on how to
handle these images, the tags in particular are being re-defined
as I make small tweaks. Please keep it mind (everything should work, though).\
I'll remove this warning once the repository stabilises.

This is a fork of the official [Resilio Sync for Docker repository](https://github.com/bt-sync/sync-docker) with small changes to be used on the all architectures supported by Resilio Sync.

This repository has just a few key differences compared to the upstream one:

  1. A makefile is provided to generate the different `Dockerfile`s and images.
  1. Multiple `Dockerfile`s are provided, one per arch. They are different from the official one in the way the image is built, to ease multi-architecture support, but the end structure is the same, except the License for Resilio Sync is also included in the image.
  1. They're based on a _debian stable slim_ image instead of on an Ubuntu image.

In practice they should work exactly the same as the official one.

The `Dockerfile`s:

* `amd64.Dockerfile`: For AMD64 aka x86_64 aka x64 (64 bit PC)
* `arm64.Dockerfile`: For ARM64 aka ARMv8 aka AArch64 (64 bit ARM)
* `armhf.Dockerfile`: For armhf aka ARMv7 (and up), (32 bit ARM with hardware float support). Superseded by `arm64`.
* `armle.Dockerfile`: For armle aka EABI ARM (ARMv5 and up), (32 bit ARM). Superseded by `armhf` and `arm64`. Docker Hub does not provided official support for this architecture. NOTE: This image isn't a part of the auto-selected architecture images (e.g. `resiliosync-multiarch:latest`), you'll have to use `resiliosync-multiarch:armle-latest` directly.
* `i386.Dockerfile`: For i386 aka x86 aka IA-32 (32 bit PC). Superseded by `amd64`. Docker Hub does not provided official support for this architecture.

## Resilio Sync

https://www.resilio.com

Sync uses peer-to-peer technology to provide fast, private file sharing for teams and individuals. By skipping the cloud, transfers can be significantly faster because files take the shortest path between devices. Sync does not store your information on servers in the cloud, avoiding cloud privacy concerns.

### Usage

```
DATA_FOLDER=/path/to/data/folder/on/the/host
WEBUI_PORT=<port to access the webui on the host>

mkdir -p $DATA_FOLDER

docker run -d --name Sync \
           -p 127.0.0.1:$WEBUI_PORT:8888 \
           -p 55555 \
           -v $DATA_FOLDER:/mnt/sync \
           --restart on-failure \
           resilio/sync
```

Note: you can use our official Docker image `resilio/sync` hosted on hub.docker.com or build image locally:
```
docker build -t resilio/sync .
```

Be sure to always run docker container with `--restart` parameter to allow Docker daemon to handle Sync container (launch at startup as well as restart it in case of failure).

Go to `http://localhost:$WEBUI_PORT` in a web browser to access the webui.

If you need to run Sync under specific user inside your container - use `--user` [parameter](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#user) or [set](https://www.linuxserver.io/docs/puid-pgid/) `PUID` and `PGID` env vars for container.

Running Sync in docker container via docker-compose is described [here](https://github.com/bt-sync/sync-docker/tree/master/docker-compose).

### Volume

* `/mnt/sync` - folder inside the container that contains the [storage folder](https://help.resilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206664690-Sync-Storage-folder), [configuration file](https://help.resilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206178884) and default download folder

### Ports

* `8888` - Webui port
* `55555` - Listening port for Sync traffic (you can change it, but in this case change it in Sync [settings](https://help.resilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204762669-Sync-Preferences) as well)

#### LAN access

If you do not want to limit the access to the webui, do not specify localhost address in `-p` parameter:

```
docker run -d --name Sync \
           -p $WEBUI_PORT:8888 \
           -p 55555 \
           -v $DATA_FOLDER:/mnt/sync \
           --restart on-failure \
           resilio/sync
```

#### Extra directories

If you need to mount extra directories, mount them in `/mnt/mounted_folders`:

```
docker run -d --name Sync \
           -p 127.0.0.1:$WEBUI_PORT:8888 \
           -p 55555 \
           -v $DATA_FOLDER:/mnt/sync \
           -v <OTHER_DIR>:/mnt/mounted_folders/<DIR_NAME> \
           -v <OTHER_DIR2>:/mnt/mounted_folders/<DIR_NAME2> \
           --restart on-failure \
           resilio/sync
```

Do not create directories at the root of `/mnt/mounted_folders` from the Sync webui since they will not be mounted to the host.
